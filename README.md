# patchEx
I desparately am in need of some tool makes that utterly boring sourcecode patching after a skribbl.io update instead of me.  
This is deigned to work in two ways:
- Inserting code after the first match group of a regex  
- Replacing text in the code to some values that are found via regex match groups.

So, my workflow is basically adding my code to the source and replacing constants in my code with values from the source found by the regex.
